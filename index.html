      <p>CMT uses third party vendors to develop, operate and maintain the App. You agree to hold Erie harmless for all actions related to the development, maintenance and utilization of the App, including the utilization of third party vendors by CMT. You also agree that Erie is not responsible for the accuracy of the data provided through the App or for the accuracy of the Data transmitted to CMT by any third-party vendor, including but not limited to, the mapping software and gift card Redemption.

        </ui>

      <h2>6. Enrollment and Operational Requirements</h2>

      <p>When you enroll in YourTurn as a Participating Driver, you agree that you have a compatible smartphone upon which the App can be installed and run.  You agree to maintain a data plan at all times and agree that you are solely responsible for all charges associated with maintaining the smartphone, including any data or messaging charges that may occur as a result of using the App. You will have the choice within the App to send collected Data through Wi-Fi networks or through cellular networks.</p>

      <p>If your smartphone is not compatible, the App will not be available for download and you will be unable to participate in YourTurn. When the App is downloaded to your device, it will record information as detailed in Section 8 Data Collection, and that information will be sent to Erie and CMT.</p>

      <p>The App uses a certain amount of power from the smartphone battery.  You are responsible for ensuring that the smartphone is adequately charged when driving, so that information can be recorded.</p>

      <p>You agree to maintain and install all device updates necessary to maintain the compatibility of your smartphone device and the App. Should you choose not to install an update, you may no longer be eligible to participate and could lose access to your YourTurn Account.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the App may require updates from time to time.  You agree that installing all required updates is your sole responsibility. You agree that once the App is downloaded to your phone, the App will not be deleted or turned off so that the App will activate each time you start a trip as delineated in Section 7. Your smartphone device must have GPS capabilities.</p>

      <h2>7. How the Program Works</h2>

      <p>In order to access the App, the Participating Driver must create an Account.  The Participating Driver must provide all Data necessary to establish the Account and is solely responsible for the accuracy of the Data. You may never use another Participating Driver’s Account without permission, or allow other individuals to use your Account. When creating an Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, including an email address at which you can be contacted. You agree not to provide knowingly false or fraudulent information, including email address.  By creating any Account that contains false information or omits any material information, you waive any rights, including those described in these Terms and Conditions.  You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account.</p>

      <p>Erie is not responsible for any use of your Account by another individual due to your failure to keep your username and password secure. You must notify Erie immediately if your username or password are lost or stolen, or if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your Account. Erie is not liable for losses caused by any unauthorized use of your Account.</p>
      
      <p>Erie reserves the right to take appropriate action against any person who:</p>
        <ui>
          <li>accesses Data or other information through fraud, misrepresentation or other unlawful act;</li>
          <li>misrepresents his or her identity;</li>
          <li>fraudulently downloads or activates the App;</li>
          <li>misrepresents eligibility for the YourTurn Rewards Program; or</li>
          <li>improperly or fraudulently accesses information on the App.</li>
        </ui>

      <p>This action may include, but is not limited to, legal action against any person accessing information in violation of any state or federal law or regulation.</p>

      <p>Once the App is installed and activated, the App and your device’s GPS capability must be active at all times to ensure accurate Data collection. The App will detect and record when a Participating Driver starts a trip. The App will determine if a Participating Driver is a driver or a passenger.  If defined as a driver, the trip will be considered a driving trip.  If defined as a passenger, the trip will be considered a non-driving trip. Only driving trips will be used to calculate a Participating Driver’s Score.  You will be able to manually exclude trips where you are not the driver.  All exclusions must be completed within 24 hours of the trip.</p>

      <p>Any disputes and concerns with the App, other than identifying a trip as non-driving, must be submitted to Erie via the contact information in the App. Erie may be required to escalate the matter to CMT. You agree to hold Erie harmless regarding any escalation of disputes or technical difficulties, as well as any scoring discrepancies.</p>

      <p>ERIE MAKES NO WARRANTIES, IMPLIED OR EXPRESSED, OR REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE APP.</p>

      <h2>8. Data Collection</h2>

      <p>The App records the following Data from your smartphone device:</p>
        <ui>
          <li>GPS and location Data</li>
          <li>Accelerometer Data</li>
          <li>Gyroscope Data</li>
          <li>Phone movement and screen activation Data</li>
          <li>Time and date</li>
          <li>App usage</li>
          <li>Battery Level</li>
        </ui>
      <p>The App uses the Data to calculate the following driving behaviors:</p>
        <ui>
          <li>Speed</li>
          <li>Acceleration</li>
          <li>Hard Braking</li>
          <li>Hard Cornering</li>
          <li>Miles Driven</li>
          <li>Phone Distraction</li>
        </ui>

      <p>The Participating Driver will be assigned a Score determined by calculating the Data using an algorithm. The scoring criteria and algorithm are the sole property of CMT. Erie does not participate in assigning the Participating Driver’s Score.</p>

      <p>This Data is transmitted wirelessly via Wi-Fi or cellular data services to CMT. This Data is used to derive the Score. The Data is then sent from CMT to Erie. It is important to understand that all of the Data collected and transmitted is based on the Data collected by the App.</p>

      <h2>9. Privacy</h2>

      <p>Erie and CMT are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

      <p>Erie will not collect, and the Participating Driver should not send, any confidential or proprietary information to CMT or Erie, except as required for YourTurn and use of the App. Erie’s collection and use of Data and personal information is governed by these Terms and Conditions, and the <a href="https://www.erieinsurance.com/privacy-notice">Erie Insurance Group Online Privacy Policy and Privacy Notice</a>, as applicable.</p>

      <h2>10. Rewards</h2>

      <p>Rewards are accumulated on a two-week basis. The two-week schedule is a predetermined schedule established by Erie that is not affected by the date of enrollment in YourTurn or the date a Participating Driver Registers. The two-week period can be located within the App. In order to earn rewards, a Participating Driver must meet all of the eligibility requirements per Section 5 and earn an Eligible Score. Rewards are awarded based upon the Participating Driver’s age, 50 tracked miles and the Participating Driver’s Score during the two-week period.  At the end of the two-week period, the Participating Driver’s Score will be reset.</p>

      <p>The Participating Driver can access the dashboard within the App to receive feedback on driving and view Scores received for trips. While a Score will be assigned for each individual criterion, the overall Score is the Score used for rewards eligibility. Rewards will be awarded within forty-eight hours after the end of the two-week period. Rewards earned by a Participating Driver may be accumulated to redeem higher value gift cards available for Redemption through the App. Reward amounts are located within the App and are subject to change at the sole discretion of Erie. If the Eligible Score or reward amounts change, the Participating Driver will be notified of the changes on the App. Continued participation and use of the App will constitute the Participating Driver’s acceptance of the changed Eligible Score and reward amounts.</p>
      
      <p>The selection of available gift cards may vary and is subject to the Terms and Conditions established by the gift card vendor, Tango.  You agree that Erie is not responsible for selecting the gift card vendor and agree to hold Erie harmless for all aspects of the App as related to Redemption, including but not limited to, the availability of gift cards, card values, problems with redeeming gift cards or reward points applicable to gift card Redemption.</p>

      <p>Any challenges to a trip must be made within 24 hours of the trip by contacting Erie Customer Care at 1-800-458-0811.  The validity of a challenge will be determined solely by Erie.  You agree to hold Erie harmless for challenge determinations.  If a challenge is successful and results in an increase in your rewards issued for the prior reward period, Erie will communicate the correction to CMT.  Your modified rewards will be distributed to you at the end of the two-week period following the challenge determination.</p>

      <p>If you do not challenge a driving Score within the above time frame, you waive your right to challenge the trip and any resulting effect such challenge may have had on your Score or rewards eligibility.</p>


      <h2>11. Program Termination</h2>

      <p>Termination of your participation in YourTurn can occur in one of four ways:</p>
        <ol type="A">

        </ol>
      
      <p><b>If a Participating Driver uninstalls the App and then reinstalls the App, the Participating Driver’s rewards will remain valid, so long as the YourTurn Rewards Program is still a valid program and the Participating Driver remains eligible at the time of reinstalling the App.  Erie will issue any outstanding rewards via an Amazon gift card. You will lose the ability to select specific gift cards, as that functionality only exists within the App. To maintain full reward selection functionality, you should Redeem all rewards prior to uninstalling the App.</b></p>

      <p><b>If you lose access to the App and cannot access earned rewards through the App, then the you may contact Erie Insurance Customer Care at 1-800-458-0811 to Redeem rewards.</b></p>

              <li>You should utilize any accumulated rewards prior to uninstalling the App as the App must be uninstalled to complete your voluntary termination in the program.

              <li>Erie requests that you contact your Erie Agent to remove the YourTurn Rewards Program Endorsement from your Policy. The YourTurn Rewards Endorsement will be removed once Erie is aware of your voluntary termination.</li>
            </ol>
          <li>Erie may terminate YourTurn at any time with at least 30 days of written notice. If Erie terminates the Program, you will have the opportunity to Redeem your earned rewards. You should Redeem all earned rewards within 14 days, if applicable, prior to uninstalling the App from your smartphone.
